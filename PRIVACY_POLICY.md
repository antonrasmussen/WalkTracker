# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2026

## 1. Who we are

**WalkTracker** is an Android app maintained by **Careful Data**. This Privacy Policy describes how the App handles information when you use it. Source code: [https://github.com/careful-data/WalkTracker](https://github.com/careful-data/WalkTracker).

## 2. Data we do not collect

WalkTracker is designed with privacy in mind:

- We **do not** run our own servers that collect your personal data.
- We **do not** collect analytics, usage data, or device identifiers for our own purposes.
- We **do not** sell or share your data with third parties for advertising or marketing.
- We **do not** require you to create an account with us.

## 3. Data stored on your device

The following data is stored **only on your device** (in the App's local storage):

- **Walk sessions:** start/end times, distance, duration, step counts, and path data (e.g. GPS points for the route).
- **Preferences:** unit system (metric/imperial), step length, and similar settings.
- **Calibration data:** values you enter for step-length calibration.

This data is not automatically sent to us or to any other party. It remains under your control and can be removed by clearing the App's data or uninstalling the App.

## 4. Fitbit integration (optional)

If you choose to connect your **Fitbit** account:

- The App uses the **Fitbit Web API** in **read-only** mode to retrieve data such as heart rate and activity for the dates/times of your walks.
- This data is requested from Fitbit only when you use the Fitbit-related features (e.g. viewing heart rate for a walk). We use it only to display it in the App (e.g. average heart rate during a session).
- We do **not** upload your walk data to Fitbit; we only **read** data that Fitbit already has.
- Fitbit's own collection, use, and sharing of data is governed by [Fitbit's Privacy Policy](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/legal/privacy-policy) and your Fitbit account settings. We do not control Fitbit's practices.
- OAuth tokens (access and refresh) are stored on your device so the App can request data from Fitbit on your behalf. We do not transmit these tokens to our own servers (we do not operate any).

## 5. Google services (optional)

If you use **Google Maps** in the App:

- Map tiles and related requests are made to Google. Google may collect data according to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We do not send your walk paths or personal data to Google beyond what is necessary to show the map and your route.
- **Google Play:** If you install the App via Google Play, Google's standard data practices apply (e.g. for app distribution and updates). We do not receive identifiable user lists from Google for the App.

## 6. Location data

The App uses your device's **location (GPS)** only while you are actively tracking a walk, in order to record your route and calculate distance. Location data is stored locally on your device as part of your walk history. We do not transmit your location to our servers (we have none) or to third parties for our own purposes.

## 7. Children's privacy

The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us (e.g. via the repository link above) and we will work to remove it.

## 8. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. For significant changes, we may provide notice where feasible (e.g. in the App or repository).

## 9. Contact

For questions about this Privacy Policy or the App's handling of data, you may open an issue or discussion at [https://github.com/careful-data/WalkTracker](https://github.com/careful-data/WalkTracker).
