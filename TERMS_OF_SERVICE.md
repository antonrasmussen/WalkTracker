# Terms of Service

**Last updated:** February 2026

## 1. Agreement

These Terms of Service ("Terms") apply to your use of **WalkTracker** ("the App"), an Android application made available by **Careful Data** ("we", "us"). By installing or using the App, you agree to these Terms.

## 2. Description of the App

WalkTracker is a personal fitness app that:

- Tracks walking sessions using GPS on your device
- Stores walk history and paths locally on your device
- Optionally displays routes on a map (e.g. via Google Maps)
- Optionally integrates with Fitbit to display heart rate and activity data during or after walks (read-only; we do not write data to Fitbit)

The App is open source. Source code is available at: [https://github.com/careful-data/WalkTracker](https://github.com/careful-data/WalkTracker).

## 3. Use of the App

You may use the App for personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms and applicable laws. You are responsible for your use of the App and for ensuring that your use does not violate any third-party rights or applicable regulations.

## 4. Third-Party Services

- **Google Maps.** If you enable map features, the App may use Google Maps and related services. Your use of those features is also subject to [Google's Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) and [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

- **Fitbit.** If you connect your Fitbit account, we use the Fitbit Web API in read-only mode to retrieve heart rate and activity data for display in the App. Your use of Fitbit integration is subject to [Fitbit's Platform Terms of Service](https://dev.fitbit.com/legal/platform-terms-of-service/) and Fitbit's privacy policies. We do not control Fitbit's services or data practices.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CAREFUL DATA AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO USE THE APP (IF ANY), OR ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS ($100), WHICHEVER IS LESS.

## 8. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. For significant changes, we may provide additional notice where feasible (e.g. in the App or repository).
